# Ansible docsite personas

Personas represent various humans who are all on different automation journeys with Ansible. These docsite personas help put users in context to identify their technical content needs at each stage of their respective journeys.

We use personas to ensure Ansible community users can find help when and where they need it. If the right support is there, users are much more likely to succeed with their goals. This leads to higher levels of adoption and a more vibrant, stronger community.

The practical goal of this document is to define a layout for a new `docs.ansible.com` homepage based on the following docsite personas.

## Novice

I'm a general technologist who has an idea about automation. I might already have a project or solution in mind and want to see if Ansible is the right tool for the job.

* **Needs:** A low barrier of entry to gain the fundamentals of Ansible automation.
* **Attitude:** Wants to understand basic concepts quickly and can find small obstacles frustrating.
* **Knowledge:** Undetermined. It is possible that I use Microsoft Windows as my primary operating system. I might even be completely new to open-source technology. I can be a Linux enthusiast doing home automation, a member of an IT team for a small business, or a solution architect for large enterprise.

## User

I write automation content like playbooks and roles. When writing playbooks and roles I like to evaluate multiple options to find simple solutions to complex problems.

* **Needs:** Needs best practice information that is up to date and complete.
* **Attitude:** Does not like out of date, incomplete, or missing documentation.
* **Knowledge:** Proficient. I am at home on the command line and enjoy technical challenges.

## Developer

I write or want to get started writing Ansible plugins and modules in Python or other programming languages.

* **Needs:** Understand programmatic options and their expected behaviour.
* **Attitude:** Technically curious and prefers verbosity.
* **Knowledge:** Basic to expert level programming ability.

## Community maintainer

I work with the community to maintain one or more collections as part of the Ansible package or I want to create my own collection, set everything up and running and maintain it. I might also be interested in working on community tooling such as Antsibull or other projects.

* **Needs:** Clear path for creating collections from scratch and optionally getting them included in the Ansible package. Guidance on lifecycles and maintenance guidelines.
* **Attitude:** Often busy with another more primary role.
* **Knowledge:** Basic to expert IT skills with project management.

## Community member/evangelist

I participate in the Ansible ecosystem community to learn and share my Ansible knowledge.

* **Needs:** Guidance on where and how I can contribute as a non-coder for Ansible projects.
* **Attitude:** Enthusiastic about Ansible.
* **Knowledge:** Intermediate or above expertise in one or more parts of Ansible.

* A quick link for advanced readers so that they can get a page that lists everything which is similar to the current ecosystem page but not with those big spacy boxes as they take up too much room.
