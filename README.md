# Landing pages for docs.ansible.com

This repository contains source templates and a Python utility to generate HTML pages and associated assets for ``docs.ansible.com``.

Join the Ansible community and help us build a better user experience for the docsite.

We talk about Ansible documentation on the [Ansible Community Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/documentation).
You're welcome to join us, discuss the Ansible docs, and share your thoughts.

The Ansible community docs group (the DaWGs) meets every Tuesday (see [the Ansible Forum Events calendar](https://forum.ansible.com/t/documentation-working-group-meeting/7229)) for details on how to add agenda items to the DaWGs meeting.
