It is completely static so there is no "make" build process.  Just open the index.html file in a browser and start editing :).

The new site index presents a high level list of subpages that direct the readers to documentation. Automation for example, links to Ansible Tower and related documentation.

Once changes are saved, docsite needs to be rebuilt in Jenkins (Project Build_Docsite) for changes to populate online.
