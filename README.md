# Landing pages for docs.ansible.com

This repository contains source templates and a Python utility to generate HTML pages and associated assets for ``docs.ansible.com``.

Join the Ansible community and help us build a better user experience for the docsite.

We talk about Ansible documentation on Matrix at [#docs:ansible.im](https://matrix.to/#/#docs:ansible.im) and on Libera IRC at ``#ansible-docs``.
You're welcome to join us, chat about the Ansible docs, and share your thoughts.

The Ansible community docs group (the DaWGs) meets every Tuesday (see [the Ansible calendar](https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/main/meetings/README.md)) and welcomes additions to our [weekly agenda items](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/678) - scroll down to find the upcoming agenda and add a comment to include your topic.
